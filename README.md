# Console-Game-Bundle
This project is a console game bundle which contains 3 minigames: Rock-Paper-Scissors, Casino Number Guessing and Hangman Game.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors 
This is a game that is played between two people. Each player in this game forms one of three shapes. The winner will be decided as per the given rules:
 * Rock vs Scissor -> Rock wins
 * Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins
 * Paper vs Scissor -> Scissor wins

In this game, the user is asked to make choices based on both computer and user choices and the results are displayed showing both computer and user choices.

### Casino Number Guessing
In this game the player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money. The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game.

Difficulty levels:
* Easy: guess one number from 4
* Mediun: guess one number from 8
* Hard: guess one number from 12

The player has 3 trials to guess the number. And the computer thinks a random number in a range, the range depends on the difficulty (the harder, the more numbers in the range).

### Hangman Game
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

Difficulty levels:
* Easy: word length - 4 letters
* Mediun: word length - 5, 6 or 7 letters
* Hard: word length - 8, 9 or 10 letters

The player has 6 attempts to guess all letters in a word, even if the letter occurs more than once (in this case the computer will show them all).
